  insights:
  - The writer spent time with the Dandelion team, which seems to be a positive and
    supportive environment where they can learn and grow. It's encouraging to see
    the writer engaged in meaningful conversations, even if they're not directly related
    to their current job.
  - The writer's Friday activities suggest a desire for self-care. They met Ngoc,
    had a conversation, and got a haircut. This indicates a need for better self-care
    and perhaps a better balance in their life between work and relaxation.
  - The writer's Friday interaction with Ngoc focused on career and relationship topics.
    This suggests a need to explore their professional and personal goals more deeply.
    Perhaps the writer could write down their career aspirations and personal values
    to clarify their intentions.
  questions:
  - What does the writer learn from their time with the Dandelion team? What aspects
    of their time there seem most helpful or meaningful?
  - How does the writer feel about their self-care activities on Friday? What might
    change to make these more meaningful or enjoyable?
  - What are the writer's career aspirations? What personal values are most important
    to them? How might they use this information to guide their decision-making and
    actions?
  themes:
  - career
  - relationships
  - selfcare

so on Wednesday, I went with the Dandelion team again because we trying to file tax and after we went to Tranquill and basically we have a conversation for the whole afternoon about various stuff about their appreciation for how they actually go to work and learn gain soft skill before they went on for graduate study. we also talk a little bit about Kai.
on Thursday I pretty much just stay at home and did nothing cause it was cold and well I went walk around a little bit and then I went to get my flu shot and that’s it.
On Friday, I met Ngoc. we had a conversation about the state job. She still doing her job and not getting up yet. We also talk about our idea regarding relationship and love and then I Work at the picket office a little bit and then after that, I just went for a haircut so this new barber is introduced to me by Khanh and Tien and he suggest me a new hairstyle it’s still a short, but it’s a little bit longer in the front and has a little bit of a bang.
