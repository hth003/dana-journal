        self.device = "cpu"  # Local deployment priority
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
            model_name,
            torch_dtype=torch.float16,
            device_map="auto",
            trust_remote_code=True
        )

- Clear cache between generations: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
- Implement model unloading when not in use

**Inference Speed**
- Use static kv-cache for consistent performance
- Implement response streaming for better UX
- Pre-compute system prompts when possible

**Quality Optimization**
