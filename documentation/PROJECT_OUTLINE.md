- **Size:** ~1.9GB after quantization (60% size reduction)
- **Performance:** ~9.5 seconds generation time, 2.1GB RAM usage
- **Integration:** Bundled quantized model with llama.cpp
- **Loading:** Lazy loading with progress indicators to prevent UI blocking
- **Processing:** Local inference only, no internet required
- **Caching:** Store reflections with content hashing to avoid regeneration
- **License:** Apache 2.0 (commercial-friendly)

- **Optimization:** Quantization reduces size from 6GB to ~1.9GB
- **Trade-off:** Moderate download size vs. high-quality psychological insights

### Storage Approach
- **Chosen:** User-selected local directory with markdown files
- **Rationale:** Portable, readable format; user controls data location
- **Benefits:** No vendor lock-in, easy backup/migration

### UI Framework
- **Chosen:** Flet (Python-based cross-platform UI)
- **Rationale:** Python ecosystem compatibility, rapid development
- **Benefits:** Single codebase for all platforms
